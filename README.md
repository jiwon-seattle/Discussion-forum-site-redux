Vote-Based Discussion Forum

Sites like Reddit, HackerNews and others offer a collection of different pages or forums where users may post news, pictures, and other information around a certain topic. Other users can then upvote or downvote content. The more upvotes an item receives, the higher it's displayed on the list. Recreate a basic subreddit and/or vote-based discussion board using React and Redux. Here are some user stories to get you started:

As a user, I want to enter content into a form and submit to create a new post.
As a user, I want my new posts to include a timestamp. And I want to see when other listings were posted, too.
As a user, I want to upvote posts I particularly enjoy.
As a user, I want to downvote posts I don't like, or find inappropriate.
As a user, I'd like posts with the most upvotes to appear higher on the page. (We haven't explicitly covered this in our curriculum, but here's a hint: You can complete logic before the return statement of a mapStateToProps() method!)
Further Exploration
As a user, I want to click a post to view additional details. For now simply hide/show some message content. (Hint: You could create a currentlySelectedPost Redux state key, and alter the value based on which post the user is selecting.)
